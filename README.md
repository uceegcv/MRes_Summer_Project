# MRes_Summer_Project

Code written specifically for analysis of data obtained for MRes Summer Project.

Zip folders anagram_task.zip and stroop_task.zip contain scripts anagrams_simple.m and stroop.m which, when run, will display the sequence used during data collection.

Scripts plot_anagram.m and plot_stroop.m require downloading DOTHUB_Toolbox (https://github.com/DOT-HUB/DOT-HUB_toolbox) and Homer2 (https://homer-fnirs.org/). These scripts extract and manipulate light intensity data parsed in .LUMO format, and return custom block-averaged graphs of the haemodynamic response.
